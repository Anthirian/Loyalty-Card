# Description
This is a project for my university in which we are required to create a Loyalty Card system. This is a system that allows customers to get credits by shopping in the same store repeatedly. Customers can spend credits to buy products in the store. The system makes use of a terminal and a smart card. The smart card contains a Java Card Applet and the terminal contains a regular Java Applet.
